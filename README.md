# The-Last-of-Us-Loading-Screen
The loading screen from the last of us where spores droop down the screen in a left to right manner. These vary in size and speed and have been adapted from a Codepen project where a coloured background and variable speed were used. I modified that to produce a version that was simpler and different to match the tone of the loading screen from the game. <br><br>The music from the Last of Us loading screens also accompanies this and loops on an autoplay. The user does have to activate this first unfortunately due to the new rules that google put in place stopping autoplay with sound and video but the controls are in the top left and once clicked the sound will loop.
